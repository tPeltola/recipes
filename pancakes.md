* 80g oat bran
* 160g whole wheat flour
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1.5 tsp baking soda
* 0.5 tsp salt
* 50g butter
* 50g vegatable oil
* 610ml buttermilk
* 2 eggs

Combine the dry ingredients. Melt butter with oil and whisk with buttermilk and eggs (if straight out of the fridge, oils should be hot enough to warm the buttermilk up to room temperature). Mix the wet ingredients into the dry until just combined. Cook on (non-stick) frying pan over medium heat about two minutes per side.
